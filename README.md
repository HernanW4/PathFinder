# PathFinder #
PathFinder using A star method. 
Is a simple PathFinder to show the ways algorithms work.

This PathFinder uses the A star method with 2 different distance methods
-Manhattan Formula
-Euclidean Formula

This PathFinder does not implement diagonals, a feature to be updated later.


(INSTRUCTIONS)
 * When Grid first loads
 * FIRST-LEFT click on any square of the grid would make a START point (GREEN SQUARE)
 * SECOND-LEFT click while START point is ACTIVE makes a END point (RED SQUARE)
 * LEFT-CLICK(DRAG LEFT-CLICK) after both START point and END are ACTIVE makes a WALL (BLACK SQUARE)
 * RIGHT-CLICK(DRAG RIGHT-CLICK) would delete any progress made
 * TO start game press SPACE-KEY (there must be a START point and END point but no need for WALLS)
 * RIGHT side of the screen, displays options on how to run the Program.
    * CHOOSE which distance methods to use (Euclidean or Manhattan's)
    * CHOOSE to make random generated map of walls.
    * SAVE map to a text file 
    * LOAD map from text file
